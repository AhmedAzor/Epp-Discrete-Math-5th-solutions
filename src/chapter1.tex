\section{Exercise Set 1.1}

{\bf In each of 1â€“6, fill in the blanks using a variable or variables to rewrite the given statement.}

\subsection{Problem 1}
Is there a real number whose square is $-1$?

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is there a real number $x$ such that \fillBlanks?

\begin{proof}
Is there a real number $x$ such that \underline{$x^2 = -1$}?
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Does there exist \fillBlanks such that $x^2 = -1$?

\begin{proof}
Does there exist \underline{a real number $x$} such that $x^2 = -1$?
\end{proof}

\subsection{Problem 2}
Is there an integer that has a remainder of 2 when it is divided by 5 and a remainder of 3 when it is divided by 6?

{\it Note: There are integers with this property. Can you
think of one?}

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is there an integer $n$ such that $n$ has \fillBlanks?

\begin{proof}
Is there an integer $n$ such that $n$ has \underline{a remainder of 2 when it is divided by 5} \underline{and a remainder of 3 when it is divided by 6}?
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Does there exist \fillBlanks such that if $n$ is divided by 5 the remainder is 2 and if \fillBlanks?

\begin{proof}
Does there exist \underline{an integer $n$} such that if $n$ is divided by 5 the remainder is 2 and if \underline{$n$ is divided by 6 the remainder is 3}?
\end{proof}
